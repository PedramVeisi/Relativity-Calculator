Special thanks to Prof. Larry Randles Lagerstrom and Coursera for this great course: https://www.coursera.org/course/einstein

Currently, I'm learning relativity. So, I may add new features to this script in the future.

How to Use:

Just download the project using the ZIP button above and run relativity_calculator.py:
python3 relativity_calculator.py

If you don't have python installed, get it form the official website: http://www.python.org/getit/
